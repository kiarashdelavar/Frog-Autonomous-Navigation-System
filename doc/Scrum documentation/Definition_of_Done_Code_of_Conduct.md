## Code of Conduct (CoC)

Our team rules for communication, responsibility, and collaboration:

- Communication is the key for successfull teamwork
- We are on time for all meetings (max 5 minutes late)
- We update the GitLab board after every task finished.
- Everyone contributes equally to tasks and discussions
- We use respectful and inclusive language
- If someone misses 2 deadlines or 3 meetings without a reason â†’ firstly, discussion with the team, if didn't work, ask
  the teacher!
- If you have delays or are not coming to the lesson/meeting, you have to text the team and the teacher with valid reason.
- If you want to select a task that is unassigned, let the other teammembers know.
- Comitting to the main branch is avoided as much as possible


**Note:**  We agreed to use **"Java FX"** for this project.
