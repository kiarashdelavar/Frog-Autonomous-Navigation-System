###  Total Story Points (Weight): **91**

This sprint has the highest number of completed tasks and total story points, reflecting the wrap-up nature of the project.

---

##  Planning Comments

- This sprint focuses on **finalizing** and **polishing**: bug fixing, documenting, refactoring, and preparing for delivery.
- Task assignment was based on prior work ownership and developer strengths.
- Refactoring was introduced late in the project. This should be started earlier in future sprints to prevent last-minute technical debt.
- Many "0" weight tasks were still essential — writing reports, documentation, and reflections — but not point-weighted to focus velocity on code tasks.

---

##  Definition of Done

A task is considered *Done* if:
- All features and fixes are implemented and tested
- Code is pushed, merged, and documented
- Final sprint reports are filled in
- Issue includes “how to demo” or test instructions if applicable

---

##  Tools & Methods Used

- **GitLab**: Planning, version control  
- **JavaFX**: GUI work  
- **Markdown**: Docs and planning reports  
- **Excel**: Time sheets  
- **Standups**: Ongoing alignment  
- **Sprint 3 Board**: Tracked 22+ tasks  

---

##  SMART Goals for Sprint 3

-  Split code earlier in future projects  
-  Finalize refactor and comment coverage  
-  Ensure every task is testable and reviewed  
-  Avoid new features unless absolutely necessary  
-  Prepare the entire app for final assessment

---

##  What's Next

- Prepare for the demo and assessment  
- Deliver final build and documentation  
- Reflect on process for future projects
