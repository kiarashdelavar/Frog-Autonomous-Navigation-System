# Sprint 3 Retrospective

## What Went Well:
1. ** Completed the project **  
   We completed the project code-wise and documentation-wise. We made it on time

2. ** Communication **
    The communication between the team members was good and also good during absence. We always sent our important messages
    in the groups chat and everybody answered.
   

3. ** GitLab **  
    This sprint we didn't encounter huge GitLab problems (like last sprint) and managed to avoid merge errors.

## What We Can Improve (For next project) :
1. ** Start with splitting up code earlier **
    Next time we need to start earlier with splitting up the code to avoid any bugs that can appear. 


##  S.M.A.R.T. Goals

### Start with splitting up code earlier
- For next project we should start 2-4 days earlier with splitting up our code
- to make sure that last minute no extra bugs will appear. And if they appear, we have more
- time to fix it
