###  Total Story Points: **89**

We deliberately planned more high-value technical stories to increase app functionality and UX. A few heavier tasks like database merging, radar graph, and CSV export/import were prioritized.

---

##  Planning Comments

- **Why these tasks?**  
  Many are essential backend and feature-complete tasks (e.g., auto-drive, mission log saving, real-time map updates). They're required for the core demo and full project delivery.

- **More task ownership**:  
  Each task was linked to a specific team member based on skill or prior progress. No more "floating" tasks without ownership.

- **Duplicate task prevention**:  
  We aimed to avoid duplicate stories by reviewing the backlog during Sprint Planning. Some slipped through but were caught early.

- **Branch structure**:  
  We switched from personal branches to **task-specific branches** to reduce merge conflicts.

- **Documentation reminders**:  
  Tasks must now include `how to demo/test` instructions and follow Java commenting standards.

---

##  Definition of Done

A task is marked *Done* if it:
- Is fully implemented and committed to GitLab
- Is pushed, merged, and tested with no unresolved conflicts
- Contains code comments and demo/testing instructions
- Is visually/behaviorally verifiable during a team review

---

##  Tools & Practices

- **GitLab**: Issues, merge requests, and planning  
- **JavaFX**: UI framework for PilotApp and Ground Control  
- **Markdown/Excel**: Timesheets and reporting  
- **Daily Stand-ups**: To align and unblock tasks  
- **Branching Strategy**: Task-based branches merged into `main`

---

##  Anticipated Risks

- Merge conflicts if branches are not synced daily  
- Overlapping work due to unclear definitions  
- Untracked hours or undocumented testing steps

---

##  SMART Goals for Sprint 2

- **Task Clarity**: All tasks reviewed and described using SMART goals  
- **Branches**: No personal branches, only task-based  
- **Progress Tracking**: Timesheet and code comments are mandatory  
- **Testing**: Tasks must include "how to demo" info  

---

##  Focus for Sprint 3

- Final bug fixes and feature polish  
- Full application testing  
- Complete documentation and prepare final delivery
