# Sprint 2 Retrospective

## What Went Well:
1. **Presence during the meetings:**  
   All team members were present during the meetings, and communication was good. The stand-up meetings were kept short and clear.

2. **Dutch stand-up was a success:**  
   The team did a Dutch stand-up for fun and team bonding, which was a success. Everyone was well-prepared, and the Dutch language was spoken clearly.

3. **Finished all tasks before the end of the sprint:**  
   Most tasks were completed before the sprint ended.

## What Didn’t Go Well:
1. **Duplicate tasks:**  
   A few duplicate tasks were created by accident. During development, it was discovered that two team members had unknowingly worked on the same task.

2. **GitLab conflicts:**  
   During the final week of the sprint, there were numerous merge conflicts, leading to outdated and conflicting code in the main branch.

3. **Farsi stand-up was less of a success:**  
   A Farsi stand-up was attempted but was less successful due to difficulties with pronunciation. Despite this, the team had fun.

## What We Can Improve:
1. **Clearer Task Definitions:**
    - Break tasks down into specific, SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals.

2. **Keep branches up to date with the main branch to avoid merge conflicts:**
    - Use branches for specific tasks instead of personal branches.
    - Ensure regular updates (e.g., `git pull`) to synchronize changes with the main branch.

3. **Documenting Progress:**
    - Track time spent on tasks.
    - Add comments in the code according to Java documentation standards.
    - Include “how to demo” or “how to test” instructions for tasks.

## SMART Goals:
1. **Task Clarity:**
    - Write detailed task descriptions, including expected outcomes.
    - Review tasks as a team before the sprint begins.
    - Apply SMART criteria to all upcoming user stories.

2. **Branches on GitLab:**
    - Use a branch for a specific task instead of personal branches.
    - Keep these branches up-to-date with the main branch; use `git pull` often.

3. **Documenting Progress:**
    - Keep the timesheet updated.
    - Add “how to demo/test” to tasks.

## Plan for Sprint 3:
- Finish the final tasks.
- Ensure all documentation is complete.
- Test the entire application.
- Wrap up the project.
