## What We Talked About

### What Went Well:

- We completed all planned tasks for Sprint 2
- Team communication got better with daily meetings
- We estimated task times well and worked efficiently
- The code was cleaner because we used smaller class files
- We balanced the weights of the tasks evenly and assigned the tasks correctly.

### What Could Be Better:

- Update your personal branches when there are new changes on main, to avoid merge conflicts as much as possible.
- Some task description were not clear enough, some of the where duplicate tasks

### How Weâ€™ll Improve:

- Write clearer, more detailed task descriptions
- Switch from personal branch to branch per task for better efficiency.
