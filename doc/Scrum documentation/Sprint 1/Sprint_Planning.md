###  Total Story Points: **68**
We carefully selected a high-value set of issues to lay the technical and design foundation of the project. Some weights were estimated as 0 for setup and planning tasks, though they required effort. 

---

##  Sprint Planning Notes

- We prioritized **core functionality** (manual driving, radar map, and UI setup) to establish the architecture of the application early.
- GitLab issues were labeled with accurate weight and priority for better planning.
- Some tasks, like time tracking and Code of Conduct, had a low story point weight but were still critical to team structure.
-  Git usage issues were anticipated but underestimated; next sprint will include **hands-on Git practice sessions**.
- SMART goals were *not yet applied to all tasks* in Sprint 1, but based on retrospective feedback, will be enforced starting Sprint 2.

---

##  Definition of Done

A task is marked as *done* if:
- It is functional and integrated.
- Code is committed, pushed, and merged on GitLab.
- The task is traceable and well-described.
- Relevant documentation is updated.
- It passes initial testing (manual or automated).

---

##  Tools Used

- **GitLab** â€“ Source control, issues, and board tracking  
- **JavaFX** â€“ UI development framework  
- **Figma / Hand sketches** â€“ Wireframes and mockups  
- **Markdown / Excel** â€“ Documentation and reporting  
- **WhatsApp / Teams** â€“ Communication  

---

##  Next Steps

- Improve communication by using daily updates in chat.
- Write clearer, SMART-formatted task descriptions.
- Reduce solo/uncoordinated work.
- Focus Sprint 2 on **bug fixing**, **refactoring**, and **documentation improvement**.
