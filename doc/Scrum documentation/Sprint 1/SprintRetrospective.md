##  What Went Well !

1. **We finished everything we planned**  
   All the tasks we set for Sprint 1 were completed. This means we planned well and worked effectively.

2. **We were productive**  
   Everyone worked at a good speed. We finished tasks on time without lowering the quality.

3. **Communication improved**  
   During the sprint, we got better at talking to each other and holding meetings. This helped us stay organized and on track.

4. **GitLab worked well**  
   We used GitLab for version control, and it helped us work together smoothly.

5. **Better code organization**  
   We split our code into smaller, easier-to-manage parts (classes), instead of having one big block. This made the code cleaner and easier to work with.

6. **Good time planning**  
   We were accurate in guessing how long each task would take. This helped us finish everything on time.

##  What Didn’t Go Well !

1. **Bad communication at the start**  
   At the beginning of the sprint, one of the team member started working on tasks without telling the rest of the team. This caused some confusion.

2. **Some tasks were unclear**  
   A few tasks didn’t have enough details. This made it harder to know exactly what to do.

##  What We Can Do Better?

1. **Make tasks clearer**  
   Before we start working, we should write detailed tasks that include exactly what needs to be done. We should use SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

2. **Talk more as a team**  
   We need to keep each other updated more often. Daily check-ins or messages in a team chat (like WhatsApp or Microsoft Teams) can help us stay on the same page.

##  S.M.A.R.T. Goals

### 1. Clearer Task Descriptions
- Write task details clearly, including what the result should look like.  
- Go over the task list together before we start the sprint.  
- Make sure all user stories follow the SMART rule:  
  - **S**pecific  
  - **M**easurable  
  - **A**chievable  
  - **R**elevant  
  - **T**ime-bound

### 2. Better Communication
- Share short daily updates about what you're doing.  
- Use a group chat or shared tool to keep in touch.  
- Make sure every piece of work is announced to the team and added to the board.

##  Plan for Sprint 2

- Keep the good energy going and finish the core parts of the project.  
- Make sure we complete all development work that’s left.  
- Get ready to focus on fixing bugs and writing documentation (as a markdown) during Sprint 2 and Sprint 3.
