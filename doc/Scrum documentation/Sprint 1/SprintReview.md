## What We Talked About

### What Went Well:

- We completed all planned tasks for Sprint 1
- Team communication got better with daily meetings
- GitLab helped us work together and stay organized
- We estimated task times well and worked efficiently
- The code was cleaner because we used smaller class files

### What Could Be Better:

- At first, some people worked on tasks without telling the team
- A few tasks were not clear enough
- Some team members had trouble using Git (merging, pushing, pulling)

### How Weâ€™ll Improve:

- Write clearer, more detailed task descriptions
- Practice Git skills (push, pull, merge, branches)
- Test work more before submitting
