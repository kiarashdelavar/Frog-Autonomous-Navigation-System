| **RFU-01**  | As a driver, I want to drive the frog in manual mode via the application, so I can correct some mistakes the automatic pilot may make.                                                                       | 5          | Must         |
| **RFU-02**  | As a driver, I want to view the received radar-points in a 2D-graph, so that I have a clear visual overview of obstacles and objects around me.                                                              | 13          | Must         |
| **RFU-03**  | As a driver, I want to start recording a mission, so I have footage on the mission of the frog.                                                                                                              | 3          | Must         |
| **RFS-03**  | The application must send the position of the frog and the position of the obstacles, so the ground control knows the location of the obstacles.                                                             | 5          | Must         |
| **RFS-04**  | The application can command the frog to automatically drive to a specific location, so the frog can check out if there are any obstacles there.                                                              | 20         | Should       |
| **RFS-05**  | The application can command the frog to drive to a pre-programmed mission ( a sequence of drive commands or coordinates ) preferably recieved from the ground control.                                                                                            | 5         | Should       |
| **RGU-01** | The operator sees/ follows the position and the direction of the Frog on a 2D-map (a given image of the part of the Asteroid where the Frog is), together with the driven route and detected obstacles.                                                                                                         | 5          | Must         |
| **RGU-02**  | As an operator, I want to view the received radar-points in a 2D-graph, so that I have a clear visual overview of obstacles and objects around me.                                                           | 8          | Must         |
| **RGU-03**  | As an operator, I want to request the pilot to drive the frog to a different location, so the driver drives the frog to the pointed location on the map.                                                     | 3          | Should       |
| **RGU-04**  | As an operator, I can send a mission log to the pilot of the frog, so the pilot knows what mission to complete.                                                                                              | 8          | Should       |
| **RGU-05** | As an operator, I want to save the collected collision points in the database, so we can always access these collision points.                                                                               | 8          | Should       |                                                                                                 | 3          | Should       |
| **RGU-06**  | As an operator, I want to convert the collected collision points from the database to a CSV file, so I can access the data from the CSV file.                                                                | 8          | Could        |
| **RGS-01**  | As a developer, I want to use JavaFX to create the application.                                                                                                                                              | 0          | Must         |
| **RGS-02**  | As an operator, I want the application to be able to receive and store mission logs with a unique ID in the database, so that I can track, manage and analyze missions based on their unique identification. | 5          | Must         |
| **RFB-01** | The application is written in Java | - |  Must|
| **RFB-02** | The application communicates with the given SASA communication library to the Frog and Ground Control. |- | Must |
